# Running the Customer Milk Purchase Simulation

## System Requirements:
*   Python 3.x
*   Required Python packages: simpy, numpy, matplotlib
```
pip install simpy, numpy, matplotlib
```

## Instructions:
1.	Install Required Packages:
*   Open a terminal or command prompt.
*   Run the following command to install the required packages:
```
python MilkPurchaseSimulation.py
```
2.	Download the Code:
*  Download the provided code file (e.g., MilkPurchaseSimulation.py) to your local machine.
3.	Run the Simulation:
*   Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the code file is located.
*   Run the following command to execute the simulation:
4.	View Results: 
*   The simulation will be run for different configurations, and the average number of customers lost will be plotted against the number of fridges. The plot will be displayed in a new window.
5.	Customizing Parameters:
*   You can customize simulation parameters, such as SIM_TIME, epsilon, alpha, gamma, and the number of fridges in the script itself before running.

6.	Important Notes:
*   The simulation might take some time to complete, depending on the specified simulation time and the complexity of the chosen parameters.
*   Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to install Python packages if you encounter any issues during package installation.
7.	Feedback and Issues:
*   If you encounter any issues or have feedback, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.
